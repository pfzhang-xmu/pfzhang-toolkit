# Foundation Potentials Selection

## Goal
Select the appropriate machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) for a given atomistic simulation task, balancing accuracy, computational cost, and material composition.

## Model Selection Guide

> [!NOTE]
> This list is not exhaustive. For a full list of available pre-trained checkpoints, refer to the `load_model` function documentation for each respective MCP server.

### MatGL Models
**Environment:** `matgl-agent`

- **CHGNet-MatPES-r2SCAN-2025.2.10-2.7M-PES**:
  - Use for r2SCAN-level inorganic materials simulation.
  - Recommended when charge information and magnetic moments are involved (e.g., calculating transition metal valence states).
- **CHGNet-MPtrj-2023.12.1-2.7M-PES**:
  - Use for compatibility with standard Materials Project (GGA/GGA+U) data.
  - Recommended when working with legacy MP data.
- **TensorNet-MatPES-r2SCAN-v2025.1-PES**:
  - Use for r2SCAN-level inorganic materials simulation.
  - Smaller and faster than CHGNet, suitable for dynamic simulations (MD, NEB, phonons).

### FAIRCHEM Models
**Environment:** `fairchem-agent`

- **uma-s-1p1**:
  - Use for organic and inorganic simulations.
  - **Note:** UMA models are typically slower and more expensive. Avoid for dynamic simulations with systems >500 atoms.
- **uma-m-1p1**:
  - Use for organic and inorganic simulations with <100 atoms.
- **esen-md-direct-all-omol**:
  - Use for organic ionic relaxation (ground state calculations).

### MACE Models
**Environment:** `mace-agent`

- **MACE-MH-1**:
  - Latest multi-head foundation model. Use as default for most tasks.
  - `omat_pbe` head (default): General materials, balanced performance.
  - `matpes_r2scan` head: High-accuracy materials simulation.
  - `omol` head: Molecular systems, organic chemistry, organometallics.
  - `spice_wB97M` head: Molecular systems and organic chemistry.
  - `oc20_usemppbe` head: Surface catalysis, adsorbates.
- **MACE-MATPES-r2SCAN-0**:
  - Specialized for r2SCAN-level inorganic systems.
- **MACE-OMAT-0-small**:
  - Small, efficient model for materials.

## Selection Criteria

Prioritize criteria in the following order:

### 0. Check the Local Model Registry (Always First)
Before selecting any foundation model, call `search_model_registry` to check whether a fine-tuned checkpoint already exists for the target chemical system:

```bash
mcp_base_search_model_registry(
    chemical_system="Li-Fe-P-O",   # elements of interest
    max_energy_mae=5.0,            # optional accuracy filter (meV/atom)
)
```

- If a match is found **and** `checkpoint_exists = True`, use that model directly — no foundation model selection or fine-tuning is needed.
- If a match is found but `checkpoint_exists = False` (file missing), fall through to the criteria below and plan a new fine-tuning run.
- If no match is found, continue with the criteria below to select the best foundation model.

> [!TIP]
> After completing any fine-tuning, always register the new model with `register_model` so it can be reused in future tasks.

### 1. User Explicit Request
If the user explicitly mentions a model name or framework (e.g., "MACE model", "fine-tuned MACE", "CHGNet", "UMA"), use that model/framework.
- Detect frameworks from keywords like: "MACE", "CHGNet", "TensorNet", "UMA", "ESEN", "FAIRCHEM", "MatGL".

### 2. Calculation Expense
If the simulation involves dynamic or expensive calculations (Molecular Dynamics, NEB, Phonons, Diffusion, Melting Temperature):
- **Prioritize smaller/cheaper models:** structure
  - `TensorNet-MatPES-r2SCAN-v2025.1-PES`
  - `MACE-MATPES-r2SCAN-0` (or MACE small variants)
- **Avoid UMA models** for dynamic simulations due to higher cost, unless the system is very small.

### 3. System Composition
Consider the chemical elements present in the system:
- **Organic (C, H, N, O, P, S)**:
  - Use **UMA models** or **MACE-MH-1** with `omol` head.
- **Inorganic**:
  - Use **MatGL**, **MACE models**, or **UMA** with `omat` head.
- **For Phase Diagrams & Thermodynamic Stability**:
  - It is highly recommended to use **MatPES-r2SCAN** trained checkpoints (e.g., `CHGNet-MatPES-r2SCAN`, `MACE-MATPES-r2SCAN`). These offer superior energy accuracy for phase stability and bypass messy energy compatibility corrections in GGA (see [mat-mp2020-compatibility](../mat-mp2020-compatibility/SKILL.md)).

### 4. Default
For general materials where no specific constraints apply:
- Use **MACE-MH-1** with `omat_pbe` head.

## Performance Benchmark
