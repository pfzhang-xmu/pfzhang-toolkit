# Stability Calculation

## Goal
To determine the thermodynamic stability of a material at 0K by computing the energy above the convex hull ($E_{hull}$) using pymatgen phase diagram analysis with structures from Materials Project.

> [!TIP]
> **Finite Temperature Stability**: While this skill focuses on 0K stability (potential energy), you can construct a finite-temperature phase diagram by replacing potential energies with **Free Energies** ($G = U + F_{\text{vib}}$) calculated from the [mat-qha-thermal-expansion](../../skills/qha-thermal-expansion/SKILL.md) skill.
>
> **Electrochemical Stability**: The phase diagram constructed here can be seamlessly reused to calculate the material's electrochemical window (ECW) against a specific mobile ion (e.g., Li/Li+). See the [mat-electrochemical-window](../mat-electrochemical-window/SKILL.md) skill for detailed methods.

## Instructions

1.  **Select Level of Theory**: Choose the target accuracy level for stability calculations.
    - **Recommended**: r2SCAN-level foundation potentials for high accuracy
    - **Options**: `TensorNet-MatPES-r2SCAN-v2025.1-PES` (MatGL) or `MACE-MH-1` with `matpes_r2scan` head
    - See [ml-foundation-potentials](../../skills/ml-foundation-potentials/SKILL.md) for detailed guidance

    **Note**: r2SCAN shows high accuracy for predicting thermodynamic stability (MAE 80 meV/atom for formation energies vs PBE's 175 meV/atom)[^1]. Using r2SCAN-trained potentials ensures consistency with Materials Project's r2SCAN entries.

"Performance comparison of r2SCAN and SCAN metaGGA density functionals for solid materials via an automated, high-throughput computational workflow" *Physical Review Materials* **6**, 013801 (2022). [DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.013801](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.013801)

2.  **Query Materials Project Hull**: Retrieve all structures on the convex hull in the target material's chemical space.
    ```bash
    # Env: base-agent
    python .agents/skills/mat-stability/scripts/query_mp_hull.py \
        --formula "Li-Fe-P-O" \
        --target "LiFePO4" \
        --thermo_type "R2SCAN" \
        --output hull_structures/
    ```

    This script will:
    - Query Materials Project for all stable phases in the chemical space (including all subsystems)
    - Download structures on the convex hull (ground state phases)
    - Filter by level of theory (e.g., GGA/GGA+U or R2SCAN) to ensure consistency
    - Save the target material and all competing phases
    - Output a `hull_entries.json` manifest

3.  **Relax All Structures**: Perform structural relaxation on all hull structures using the same MLIP.
    ```bash
    # Env: matgl-agent (if using MatGL)
    mcp_matgl_relax_structure(
        structure_data="hull_structures/",  # Pass directory containing all CIF files
        relax_cell=True,
        model_name="TensorNet-MatPES-r2SCAN-v2025.1-PES",
        fmax=0.02,
        steps=500,
        output_dir="relaxed/"
    )
    ```

    The MCP tool will automatically:
    - Process all CIF files in `hull_structures/`
    - Create individual subdirectories in `relaxed/` for each structure
    - Save energies to `relaxed_energy.txt` files for compute_ehull.py

    **Critical**: Use the **same MLIP and settings** for all relaxations to ensure energy consistency.

4.  **Construct Convex Hull & Calculate Stability**: Build a pymatgen phase diagram using the relaxed energies.
    ```bash
    # Env: base-agent
    python .agents/skills/mat-stability/scripts/compute_ehull.py \
        --hull_manifest hull_entries.json \
        --relaxed_dir relaxed/ \
        --target_material LiFePO4 \
        --calculate_ecw \
        --mobile_ion Li \
        --output stability_analysis.json
    ```

    The script will:
    - Read relaxed structures and energies from each subdirectory
    - Create `ComputedEntry` objects for pymatgen
    - Construct the convex hull using `PhaseDiagram`
    - Calculate $E_{hull}$ for the target material
    - (Optional) If `--calculate_ecw` is provided, calculate the intrinsic Electrochemical Stability Window ($V_{red}$ and $V_{ox}$) against the specified `--mobile_ion`.

5.  **Interpret Stability**: Assess the thermodynamic stability based on $E_{hull}$ (energy above hull in meV/atom):
    - **$E_{hull} = 0$ meV/atom**: **STABLE** - On the convex hull, thermodynamically stable
    - **$0 < E_{hull} \leq 50$ meV/atom**: **METASTABLE** - May be synthesizable under kinetic control
    - **$E_{hull} > 50$ meV/atom**: **UNSTABLE** - Likely to decompose into competing phases

    The decomposition reaction and products are also reported by pymatgen.

## Examples

### Example 1: Integrated Stability and ECW Pipeline for Li3PS4
```bash
# Step 1: Query Materials Project hull in Li-P-S space
# Env: base-agent
python .agents/skills/mat-stability/scripts/query_mp_hull.py \
    --formula "Li-P-S" \
    --target "Li3PS4" \
    --thermo_type "R2SCAN" \
    --output hull_structures/

# Step 2: Batch relax all structures with MatGL r2SCAN
mcp_matgl_relax_structure(
    structure_data="hull_structures/",
    relax_cell=True,
    model_name="TensorNet-MatPES-r2SCAN-v2025.1-PES",
    fmax=0.05,
    steps=20,
    output_dir="relaxed/"
)

# Step 3: Compute Integrated Stability and ECW
# Env: base-agent
python .agents/skills/mat-stability/scripts/compute_ehull.py \
    --hull_manifest hull_entries.json \
    --relaxed_dir relaxed/ \
    --target_material Li3PS4 \
    --calculate_ecw \
    --mobile_ion Li \
    --output Li3PS4_stability_ecw.json
```

We also provide a stored record of this example run in `examples/li3ps4_stability/`.

## Constraints

- **Energy Consistency**: All structures (target + hull phases) MUST be relaxed with the **same MLIP model and settings**. Mixing different MLIPs will produce incorrect E_hull values.
- **Level of Theory**: Use r2SCAN-trained foundation potentials (e.g., `MACE-MH-1 matpes_r2scan`) for better accuracy and consistency with Materials Project.
- **Convergence Criterion**: Use `fmax ≤ 0.02 eV/Å` for all relaxations. Inconsistent convergence criteria will introduce systematic errors.
- **Chemical Space**: The query must include ALL elements in the target material. For example, for LiFePO4, query "Li-Fe-P-O" not just "Li-Fe-P".
- **Hull Completeness**: Ensure all competing phases are included. Missing hull phases will lead to underestimated E_hull (false negatives for instability).
- **Hull Reuse**: If calculating the stability of multiple different structures in the same chemical space, we should reuse the hull instead of relaxing them again.
- **Stability Thresholds**:
  - $E_{hull} = 0$ meV/atom: **Stable**
  - $0 < E_{hull} \leq 50$ meV/atom: **Metastable**
  - $E_{hull} > 50$ meV/atom: **Unstable**
- **Phase Diagram Construction**: For full phase diagram visualization and competing phase analysis, see the separate phase-diagram skill (to be developed).
- **Energy Input**: Use **TOTAL POTENTIAL ENERGY** for all entries in `pymatgen.analysis.phase_diagram.PhaseDiagram` automatically calculates formation energies by identifying elemental ground states from the provided entries. Do not pass formation energies directly.
- **High-Throughput Self-Competition**: When computing $E_{hull}$ for multiple generated candidates, place all relaxed structures in `relaxed_dir`. `compute_ehull.py` will automatically load all candidates and include them in the `PhaseDiagram` alongside the Materials Project hull reference. This correctly enables generated candidates to thermodynamically compete against each other.
- **DFT Validation**: For publication-quality results, validate E_hull with DFT calculations, especially for materials close to the stability threshold.
